## Skip JavaScript Library

This library is a convenient way to add functions to your JavaSCript without adding a new variable. After importing you can chain these functions like other pre-made functions on MDN.<br/>

This is a JavaScript library in vanilla JavaScript to help you with your JavaScript functions. These are pre-made chaining functions that allow you to skip certain indexes while using map, filter, forEach, reduce, etc. This is helpful in projects where you would use map and needed to select which indexes need to be changed by default they change every index like the given function. However, you have the option to skip indexes if needed.<br/>

### Installation

`npm install skip-js`<br/>

At the top of your file enter <br/>
`require('skip-js');` <br/>
